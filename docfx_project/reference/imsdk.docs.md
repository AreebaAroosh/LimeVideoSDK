# Intel Media SDK Reference Documentation
The Lime Video SDK uses the Intel Media SDK to get access to the Quick Sync functions inside the CPU and GPU.
Sometimes it can be helpful to review the documentation for the low layer C++ SDK when using the Lime Video SDK.

Our preferred method for viewing the documentation is to download the latest version of the Intel Media SDK, install it,  and to find this file in the distribution: *mediasdk-man.pdf*

You might also find this link useful: https://software.intel.com/en-us/media-sdk/documentation
But our experience is that the online-reference documentation is incomplete, and we believe you will have a better experience with the PDF files from the SDK downloads.
